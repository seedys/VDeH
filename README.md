# VDeH

## Codes for SIGMOD'25: Voronoi Diagram Encoded Hashing: A No-Learning Data-Dependent Approach for Large-Scale Information Retrieval

## File Structure
demo.m: the main execution file of the project.
./utils: some calculation functions
./Method-VDeH: our proposed method
./Method-LSH: no-learning LSH for simple comparison
./DB-FeaturesToBeProcessing: original dataset
./DB-FeaturesAfterProcessing: dataset for train and test partitioning

## Installation
This project does not require special installation steps, simply clone or download the project files to your local system.

## Usage
Place your .mat format datasets in the ./DB-FeaturesToBeProcessing folder.
Modify the parameter settings in demo.m as per your requirements, selecting different datasets name.
Run the demo.m file to execute the project.

## Test Datasets
Datasets can be obtained from the links in the paper.
For convenience, eg. [Cifar10-Gist512.mat](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1o877VXC)

### Please use Matlab R2021b or a newer version.
